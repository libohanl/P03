      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>I'm a forth year SIAT Student and currently focusing on studying film making abilities such as photographing, editing and colour correction. To me , my major provides a platform and opportunity to reinforce my skills, also makes us able to experience entire film production process and acquire knowledges from it.</p>

      <h2>Haida Now</h2>

      <p>Local Haida Artists shared their insights and knowledge about the art pieces, providing visitors with the opportunity to experience a powerful way to engage with the worldview and sensibility of the Haida people while gaining greater appreciation for the role museums can play in the reconciliation movement.
  
      During the process of creating this documentary, our team had group meeting once a week. Mostly, we assigned weekly jobs to each group member and each of us would bring the outcomes on next week's meeting.  
      For the filming stage, my role was to set up an A-roll camera and record some B-rolls as well. After that, I did transcribing on 10 mins of our A-rolls and typed them on google drive. On editing stage, one of my teammates was the film editor and we gave assistances to him.In the end, I used adobe premiere to colour corrected the entire film ,and now the film is ready to play.
